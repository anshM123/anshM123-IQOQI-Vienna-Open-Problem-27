# CONE_d for all d > 2000: proof of QD2-C2 (D_1 = 2000)

Status (2026-10-01; rigour pass and re-run 2026-10-02): PROVED, computer-assisted (interval arithmetic) -- CONE_d holds for EVERY d >= 2001
(QD2-C2 with D_1 = 2000).
Together with QD2-T1 (d <= 200) and QD2-T2 (201 <= d <= 2000), CONE_d holds for all d >= 2, i.e. QD2-C1 is PROVED (computer-assisted).
Complete proofs of every step, the code fixes of 2026-10-02 (G6, G7, constants) and the re-run: RIGOR_ALLD.md.
Reproduce: python run_alld.py 12 (all scripts, ~25 min) or python audit_alld.py ->  'ALL-D CERTIFIED' (reads logs/alld/*.json; section 12).  Tags: PROVED (analytic), CERTIFIED (interval arithmetic, script + log),
NUMERICAL (non-rigorous evidence only).  Notation as in CONE_PROOF.md and LOG.md sections 7-8.

## 0. Setting
d >= 2001, eps = 1/d, A0 = pi/2 - 1, kappa_n(b) = d^n/db^n [b psi(b+1)], B(b) = b kappa_2(b), f(b) = b^2 (1/B(b) - 1), f(0) = 0.
F(b) = F_s(b) + F_r(b), F_s(b) = (4d/pi) b [psi(b+1) - psi(d+1)], F_r(b) = d^2 sum_{i odd} g_i (b)_i/(d)_i  (g_r = sum g_i x^i).
c_j(b) = [F^(2j)(b) - F^(2j)(d-b)]/(2^j j!),  tau_m = Dlt(m) - Dlt(d-m),  Dlt = P_{v,r} - F_r  (CONE_PROOF.md, Lemma R2).
For 1 <= m < d/2 the decoupled equation (D_m) of CONE_PROOF.md is  Hc_m(t) = tau_m,  Hc_m(t) := [H(m,t) - F(m)] - [H(d-m,t) - F(d-m)],
H the truncated Gaussian average of Lemma R4.  Phi_*(m) := a root of (D_m) (existence: section 8), Phi_*(d-m) = Phi_*(m), Phi_*(0) = 0,
and for even d, Phi_*(d/2) := Phi_e(d/2) (the antisymmetric equation is vacuous there; any value is admissible).
F_A(m) = A0 eps [f(m) + f(d-m) - f(d)],  D_B[X] := Delta^4 (X - F_A) (periodic centred 4th difference on Z_d).

## 1. Reduction to a smooth model plus a pointwise error (Lemma P)  [PROVED]
LEMMA P.  Let Phi = Phi_e + delta on Z_d, both symmetric with value 0 at m = 0, |delta(m)| <= delta_max.  If
   D_B[Phi_e](1) >= -gamma eps^2   and   D_B[Phi_e](m) >= beta eps^3  (2 <= m <= d/2),
then for 1 <= k <= d/2, with P := 16 A0 (A_min - 0.1446/(d-1)) and w_k = 1 (k < d/2), 1/2 (k = d/2):
   at_k(Phi) >= w_k [ (eps^2/8) (P - 4 gamma^2/(beta d (1 - 4/d))) - 2 delta_max ].
Proof.  at_k is linear and |at_k(delta)| <= w_k (2/d) sum_m |delta(m)| <= 2 w_k delta_max.  For Phi_e, QD2-L11 (with QD2-L12) gives
8 d s^4 at_k(Phi_e)/w_k = S(theta) >= P eps s^4 - 4 gamma eps^2 s^2 + beta eps^2 (1 - 4 eps) (s = sin(pi k/d)); with y = 1/s^2 >= 1,
S/(8 d s^4) = (eps^2/8)[P - 4 gamma eps y + beta eps (1 - 4 eps) y^2] >= (eps^2/8)[P - 4 gamma^2 eps/(beta (1 - 4 eps))].  []
(The m = 1 and m = d-1 terms both carry D_B(1); sum_{m=2}^{d-2} (1 - cos m theta) = d - 2 + 2 cos theta >= d - 4.)
(0.1446/(d-1) = 2 * 0.0723/(d-1) bounds the tail 2 sum_{m>=d} a(m) of QD2-L12.)
NUMBERS.  A_min >= 0.105487 (QD2-L12), so P >= 0.96273 for d >= 2001.  Sufficient targets: gamma = 3, beta = 1/4, delta_max = eps^2/20 give
   at_k(Phi) >= w_k eps^2 { [0.96273 - 36/(0.25 * 2001 * 0.998)]/8 - 1/10 } = 0.011 w_k eps^2 > 0,
i.e.  D_B[Phi_e](1) >= -3 eps^2,  D_B[Phi_e](m) >= eps^3/4 (m >= 2),  |Phi_* - Phi_e| <= eps^2/20 at integers, plus the slack condition and
the tail lemma (sections 9-10).  The values actually certified are much better (section 11: gamma = 2.765192, beta = 6.0224,
delta = 6.6468e-4 eps^2, at_k >= 0.11869 w_k eps^2).  Complete proofs of Lemma P and QD2-L11: RIGOR_ALLD.md s.3; of QD2-L12 (Fejer/Polya,
A_min >= 0.1054878997577, certified by t35_polya.py, logs/alld/polya.json): RIGOR_ALLD.md s.4.

## 2. The smooth model Phi_e  [definitions]
For real b in (0, d), x = b/d, w = 1/b = eps/x, v = 1/(d-b) = eps/(1-x):
  Gamma(x, eps) := F_r(b)/d^2 = sum_{i odd} g_i P_i(x, eps),  P_n := prod_{k<n} (x + k eps)/(1 + k eps)  (= E X^n, X ~ Beta(b, d-b));
  F_r^(n)(b) = d^(2-n) d_x^n Gamma;  Gamma(1-x, eps) = sum_n a_n P_n(x, eps) with a_n := (-1)^n g_r^(n)(1)/n!  (X_{d-b} = 1 - X_b in law);
  B_2j(b) := b^(2j-1) kappa_2j(b)/(2j-2)!  (Binet functions, B_2j(b) -> 1);  k_j := 2 (2j-2)!/(2^j j!).
  Ch_j(b) := (pi/2) eps^j b^(2j-1) c_j(b)
          = eps^(j-1) { k_j [B_2j(b) - (x/(1-x))^(2j-1) B_2j(d-b)] + (pi/2) x^(2j-1) d_x^2j S(x,eps)/(2^j j!) },  S := Gamma(x) - Gamma(1-x).
  Euler-Maclaurin interpolant of P_{v,r}:  Pt(b) := d^2 [p(x) - x (p(1) - g_r(1))],  p := g_r - (eps^2/12) g_r'' + (eps^4/240) g_r''''
  (p(0) = 0 since g_r is odd; Pt(0) = 0, Pt(d) = d^2 g_r(1) as for P_{v,r}).  tau_e(b) := [Pt - F_r](b) - [Pt - F_r](d-b),
  tauh_e := (pi/2) tau_e/b = (pi/2) [Tt + EMx]  with the cancellation-free forms (a04_regular.py):
     Tt = sum_n (g_n - a_n) Qt_n,  Qt_n := (x^n - P_n)/(eps x),  Qt_{n+1} = Qt_n r_n - x^(n-1) n (1-x)/(1 + n eps),  Qt_0 = Qt_1 = 0;
     EMx = sum_{k=1,2} aEM_k eps^(2k-1) [g^(2k)(x)/x - (g^(2k)(1-x) - g^(2k)(1))/x - 2 g^(2k)(1)],  aEM = (-1/12, 1/240).
  (Derivation, RIGOR_ALLD.md Prop. T: T := eps tau_e = [(p - Gamma)(x) - (p - Gamma)(1-x) + (1 - 2x)(p(1) - g_r(1))]/eps;
   g_r(x) - Gamma = sum g_n (x^n - P_n), g_r(1-x) - Gamma(1-x) = sum a_n (x^n - P_n), and the Euler-Maclaurin part, including the
   linear term, gives EMx after division by x.)
MODEL.  u_e(b) := the root in (0, 1) of  sum_{j=1}^{4} Ch_j(b) u^j = tauh_e(b)  (unique: section 3), and  Phi_e(b) := eps b^2 u_e(b).
Equivalently Phi_e(b) is the root t of  sum_{j<=4} c_j(b) t^j = tau_e(b)  (multiply by (2/pi) b).  Since c_j and tau_e are antisymmetric
under b -> d-b, Phi_e(d-b) = Phi_e(b).  On Z_d:  Phi_e(m) as above for 1 <= m <= d-1, Phi_e(0) := 0.
CHECK [NUMERICAL, a01_model.py, a04 test]: with J = 7 and the discrete tau the model reproduces the certified Phi_* (d = 1000) to 1e-18
relative; tauh_e - (pi/2) tau_m/m ~ 2e-17 at d = 1000.

## 3. Inner identities  [PROVED: RIGOR_ALLD.md s.2 (Lemmas M1-M3, Props. T, E, W, Thm. I); CHECKED: a14_identities.py]
At fixed b, as eps -> 0 (x = eps b):  B_2j(d-b) = 1 + O(eps^2), x/(1-x) = eps b + O(eps^2), S'' = g_r''(x) - g_r''(1-x) + O(eps),
g_r''(0) = 0, g_r''(1) = 2 - 4/pi, g_r'''(1) = 4/pi, g_3 = pi/36.  Hence
  Ch_1 = B(b) - (pi/2) eps b + O(eps^2),  Ch_2 = eps b^3 kappa_4(b)/4 + O(eps^2),  Ch_j = O(eps^2) (j >= 3),
  tauh_e = A0 + eps (pi/2)[-(1 + pi/12) b + t1c] + O(eps^2),  t1c = -(2/3 + 5pi/72 + 1/(3pi))
(Heuristic route via the discrete tau: Dlt(b) = eps[-3 g_3 b^2 - (5/2) g_3 b + g_r''(1) b/12] + O(eps^2), Dlt(d-b) = -(g_r''(1)/2) b
 + eps[(g_r''(1)/2)(b^2 + b) + (g_r'''(1)/6)(3b^2 + 2b) - (b/12)(g_r''(1) - g_r'''(1))] + O(eps^2).  The PROOF works with the model
 itself, tauh_e = (pi/2)(Tt + EMx), Ch_j as defined above: RIGOR_ALLD.md Prop. E.)
Therefore u_e(b) = U0 + eps b U1 + O(eps^2) with
  (I1)  b^2 U0 = A0 b^2/B(b) = phi_1(b),   (I2)  b^3 U1 = phi_2(b)  (the explicit function of QD2-L10, a08_A2.py).
Checks (a14_identities.py, logs/alld/identities.json): exact sympy derivation of the expansions and of b^3 U1 - phi_2 = 0; an
independent 90-digit implementation (model solved at x = 1e-5..8e-5, 17 values of b in [1, 1000]) gives I1 to 1e-29 and I2 to
6e-25 relative; interval jets at x = 0 contain A0/B and phi_2/b^3 at 161 values of b and at w = 0; omega(0, w) = -(1 - 2/pi).

## 4. Exact decomposition of D_B  [PROVED; details and the zone bookkeeping: RIGOR_ALLD.md s.6]
Write u_e(x, w) (x = eps b, w = 1/b) and Taylor-expand in x at fixed w:  u_e = U0(w) + x U1(w) + x^2 R2(x, w).  Then
  Phi_e(b) = eps A0 b^2/B(b) + eps^2 phi_2(b) + eps^3 b^4 R2(x, w),  and  eps A0 b^2/B(b) = eps A0 b^2 + A0 eps f(b),
so, since Delta^4 kills the quadratic eps A0 b^2 (also with the even extension at m = 1, 2):
  D_B[Phi_e](m) = eps^2 A_2(m) + eps^3 Delta^4[b^4 R2](m) - A0 eps Delta^4[f(d-b)](m),     A_2 := Delta^4 phi_2 (even extension).
For m >= 3 the stencil lies in [1, d-1] and  Delta^4 g(m) = int_{-2}^{2} g''''(m+s) M_4(s) ds  (M_4 = cardinal B-spline, >= 0, mass 1), and
  d_b^4 [b^4 R2] = Lambda(R2),  Lambda := (th+1)(th+2)(th+3)(th+4),  th := x d_x - w d_w   (d_b = w th at fixed eps).
OUTER FORM (no x-expansion, used for x >= 0.011):  eps^(-3) Delta^4[Phi_e - eps A0 b^2/B](m) = int Q_O(x_s, eps) M_4(s) ds,
  Q_O := d_x^4 [x^2 (u_e - A0/B(1/w))] at fixed eps;  and Delta^4[eps A0 b^2/B - F_A] = -A0 eps Delta^4 f(d-b).

## 5. Outer zone  x in [0.011, 0.501]  [CERTIFIED: a06_zoneO.py; logs/alld/zoneO_*.json]
For every box x in [x_lo, x_hi] and every eps in [0, 1/2001] (all d >= 2001; eps = 0 included), Q_O(x, eps) is enclosed by a Taylor
model: thin centre jets (x_c, eps_c) up to order 4+K-1 in x and 1 in eps, x-remainder of order K = 3 from jets over (x-box, eps_c), and
the eps^2 remainder from jets over the full box; model root by Krawczyk, root jets by implicit differentiation; for x < 0.03 the eps-range
is split geometrically (w = eps/x then moves little per piece; cut points are 120-bit values reaching 1/2001 exactly -- the earlier
53-bit cut points stopped 1.6e-20 below 1/2001, RIGOR_ALLD.md s.1); for x_hi > 0.4201 the remainder jets use the box enlarged to [x_lo, 1/2] and
the exactly antisymmetric coefficients are divided by (1-2x) (coefficient shift, valid since Ch_j(1/2) = tauh_e(1/2) = 0 exactly).
RESULT (re-run 2026-10-02, RIGOR_ALLD.md s.11): Q_O >= 9.149 on [0.03, 0.501] (pieces: [0.03,0.10] 9.149, [0.10,0.30] 11.405,

Hence for every stencil inside x >= 0.011:  D_B[Phi_e](m) = eps^3 int Q_O M_4 - A0 eps Delta^4 f(d-b) >= eps^3 (min Q_O - 2.03e-11)

P(E^c) <= 2d exp(-9/(32 Phi(1))) <= 2d exp(-0.426 d),  eps_tail <= (3d/8) sup|F'| P(E^c),  sup|F'| <= (4d/pi)(H_d + 1) + 8d,
r = 8 eps_tail/min c_1 with min_{m<d/2} c_1(m) >= (4/pi) Ch*_min/d (Ch_1 = (1-2x) Ch*_1, d - 2m >= 1).  For d >= 2001 these are
< 10^(-300); the margins of Lemma P (at_k >= 0.09 eps^2) and of section 9 (Delta^2 W >= c eps) exceed 2r and 4(r sup|F''| + eps_tail).
FIXED POINT (CONE_PROOF.md, Lemma B; added 2026-10-01 by the main session).  The step from the decoupled equations (D_m) to the exact
equations is Poincare-Miranda on the IVT intervals of section 8, widened by rho.  It needs a certified lower bound for the derivative
of Hc_m on the boxes; a12_fp_alld.py records Fp >= 0.152041 (min over the 159 a10 boxes, logs/alld/fp_alld.json), i.e.
F'(u) >= 0.152 on [0, U + 1e-3] (F'(u)/(1 - 2x) >= 0.152 in the half-boxes), hence Hc_m' >= (2/(pi eps m)) 0.152/d >= 0.19/d, and
rho = 2 eps_tail d/0.19 <= 10^(-363) (d >= 2001, decreasing in d).  The at_k and slack margins absorb 2 rho and 4(eps_tail + rho d^2)
(|d_t H| <= (1/2) sup|F''| + |Bd| <= (2 pi/3) d + 8.38 + exp-small <= d^2).  Monotonicity in d of every margin: RIGOR_ALLD.md s.8.
audit_alld.py checks this in interval arithmetic; the same single run also audits 2 <= d <= 200 (LP certificates) and 201 <= d <= 2000
(it calls audit_cert_g.py on the unified certificates logs/cert_g_d{d}.json of verify_cert.py).

## 11. Assembly: CONE_d for every d >= 2001  [PROVED, computer-assisted; audit_alld.py]
Fix d >= 2001.  (1) Section 8: for 1 <= m < d/2 the decoupled equation (D_m) has a root Phi_*(m) with |Phi_*(m) - Phi_e(m)| <=
6.6468e-4 eps^2; set Phi_*(d-m) = Phi_*(m), Phi_*(0) = 0, Phi_*(d/2) = Phi_e(d/2).  (2) Sections 4-7 and A_2 >= 0 (a08):
D_B[Phi_e](1) >= -2.765192 eps^2 and D_B[Phi_e](m) >= beta eps^3 for 2 <= m <= d/2 with beta = min(inner 6.022431, outer 7.419184,
m = 2: 206.884) - (F_A tail 2.03e-11) = 6.022431.  (3) Lemma P with gamma = 2.765192, beta = 6.022431, P >= 0.962733394 (A_min from t35):
at_k >= w_k eps^2 [(P - 4 gamma^2/(beta d (1-4/d)))/8 - 2 * 6.6468e-4] >= 0.1186944 w_k eps^2 > 0 for all k (on the whole Poincare-
Miranda box, up to 2 rho).  (4) Section 9: Delta^2 W(m) >= (0.651054 - 0.030900) eps = 0.620154 eps for all m.  (5) Section 10:
tail and fixed-point margins hold with log-margins > 800 (d = 2001 is the worst case, RIGOR_ALLD.md s.8).  Hence, by Lemma B, the
Gaussian-modulated Dirichlet process of CONE_PROOF.md (Lemmas R1-R4) satisfies (i) and (ii) of Lemma R1, i.e. CONE_d holds.  With
QD2-T1 (2 <= d <= 200) and QD2-T2 (201 <= d <= 2000):  CONE_d HOLDS FOR EVERY d >= 2 (QD2-C1).
SLACK RESULTS (density Delta^2 W_e/eps, lower bounds): outer [0.011,0.0205] 0.8394, [0.0205,0.03] 0.8318 (eps split), [0.03,0.27] 0.7017,
[0.27,0.501] 0.6511; inner b in [1,2] 0.8621, [2,5] 0.8535, [5,20] 0.8371, w in [0,0.05] 0.8261; m = 1: 0.9100.  Perturbation
4 max|W - W_e|/eps <= 4 (11.5703 * 6.6468e-4 + 138.103/2001^2 + 235.59/(8 * 2001^3)) = 0.0309.  Hence Delta^2 W(m) >= 0.620 eps.

numerics, jets), t35_polya.py (QD2-L12, A_min), test_exact.py (G6 tests), run_alld.py (driver), audit_alld.py (exact coverage + all
margins; also audits d <= 200 and, via audit_cert_g.py, 201..2000), lp_reverify.py (optional re-verification of the d <= 200 LP
certificates), a01_model.py (non-rigorous prototype, used only for cross-checks).
Logs (logs/alld/, one run of run_alld.py, 2026-10-02): zoneO_{0a1,0a2,0b1,0b2,1,2,3a,3b,3c}, zoneI_{b1,b2,b3,w1,w2,w3},
slackW_{O0a,O0b,O1a,O1b,I1,I2a,I2b,I3}, slack_m1, A2, smallm, pointwise, fp_alld, constants, polya, identities (.json, exact rational
bounds as strings) and the .log of every job; test_exact.log, a01_model_d{1000,2000}.log, run_alld.log, audit_alld.log.
Superseded logs (before the fixes of RIGOR_ALLD.md): logs/alld/archive_pre_rigor/.
NUMERICAL cross-check (a01 prototype, exact discrete tau, Gaussian order 7, d = 4000): d^2 D_B(1) = -2.7514; d^3 D_B(m) = 407.1, 47.1,
15.2, 11.0, 9.93, 9.90, 10.23, 13.39 for m = 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 20, 100, 1000 -- consistent with the certified lower bounds.
Scope note: the reduction CONE_d => (*) => F <= F_DKZ is QD2-L1/R1; Lemmas R1-R4 and Lemma B (fixed point) of CONE_PROOF.md are used;
their margin conditions are verified in section 10 for all d >= 2001 and by verify_cert.py / audit_cert_g.py for 201 <= d <= 2000.

REMARK (what exactly is proved vs. the original formulation of QD2-C2).  The 4th-difference bounds D_B(1) >= -2.765192 eps^2 and
D_B(m) >= 6.0224 eps^3 are certified for the smooth model Phi_e; the actual decoupled solution satisfies |Phi_* - Phi_e| <= 6.6468e-4 eps^2
pointwise, and this perturbation is absorbed at the level of the variogram coefficients (Lemma P: |at_k(delta)| <= 2 max|delta|), not of
4th differences.  So the literal pointwise statement "Delta^4(Phi_* - F_A)(m) >= eps^3" is not claimed (it is not needed): what is proved is
the conclusion QD2-C2 was designed for, namely at_k(Phi_*) >= 0.11869 w_k eps^2 > 0 for all k, the slack Delta^2 W > 0, and the tail margins,
for every d >= 2001; hence CONE_d.
